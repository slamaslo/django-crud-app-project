# Watchlistr

## Description

Watchlistr is a Django-based movie tracking application that allows users to manage their personal movie collections. Users can add movies to their watchlist, track their viewing status (To Watch, Watching, Watched), rate movies, mark favorites, and add personal notes. The app features user authentication and provides a clean, intuitive interface for movie management.

This project was built as a practice exercise to demonstrate CRUD operations in Django, user authentication, and responsive web design principles.
